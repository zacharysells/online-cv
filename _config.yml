#Profile information
name: Zachary Sells
tagline: DevOps/Software Engineer
pic: profile.png 
summary: "I started my career as a software engineer developing python APIs. \
Our small team had the need to deploy our application publicly on the cloud. \
That's when I got into the DevOps/CloudOps space using Docker, Terraform, and AWS. \
<br>
<br>
At my current job, I work with multiple clients in the CloudOps space. I manage their \
cloud infrastructure in AWS. Since AWS offers a wide range of services, and each \
client has different use cases, I've become familiar with lot's of various technologies \
and have excelled at learning new things quickly."
